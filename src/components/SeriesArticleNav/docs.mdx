# SeriesArticleNav

Simple widget to add in article navigation between a series of related articles.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="interactive-components-seriesarticlenav--default" />
</Canvas>

Will dispatch an "update" event when the button is cliced and after the component updates.

```javascript
const dispatch = createEventDispatcher();

dispatch("update");
```

This is useful when used as a widget placed inside a Core Media article to send a message to the parent article that the iframe needs to be resized.

Normally, the article in which the widget is placed will also be part of the list of articles listed to - as it is part of the series. If the `parentDoi` listed in the `seriesArticleNavData` object matches the doi of the current page - this is indicated with a left border and setting `aria-current="page"` on the link.
