    title: "A robotic Petri dish: How to grow human cells in a robot shoulder",
    info: "Human cells grown in the lab could one day be used for a variety of tissue grafts, but these cells need the right kind of environment and stimulation. New research suggests that robot bodies could provide tendon cells with the same kind of stretching and twisting as they would experience in a real human body. It remains to be seen whether using robots to exercise human cells results in a better tissue for transplantation into patients.",

    info: "Pyramids and canals built by an ancient civilisation have been discovered beneath the forests of the Bolivian Amazon. LiDAR technology allowed archaeologists to see through the canopy to reveal hundreds of previously unknown structures and settlements from the Casarabe culture of 500-1400 AD. In this film archaeologist Heiko Prümers describes his work in a region long thought to be unable to support complex ancient societies.",

    info: "Around the world, video meetings have become the new normal – but what impact could this have on our work? Our reporter jumps online to find out how face-to-face conversations differ from their virtual equivalents. According to new research one important skill is impacted by the restrictions of video calls: creativity. But why is idea generation negatively affected? And could other skills actually benefit from virtual communication?",

Now a neural network, trained on thousands of existing inscriptions, could help historians figure out when and where a piece of writing comes from - as well as fill in missing words and characters.",
